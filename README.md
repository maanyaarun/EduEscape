EduEscape
EduEscape converts any study PDF into an interactive escape-room style learning experience.
It replaces passive revision with active recall, timed challenges, and concept-based puzzles to improve retention.

How It Works
-> EduEscape takes an uploaded PDF and automatically turns each topic into a timed escape-room level.
-> The system uses multiple coordinated agents:
-> PDF Reader Agent — extracts text from the uploaded PDF
-> Topic Extraction Agent — identifies chapters/topics
-> Escape Room Generator Agent — creates puzzles, clues, and level structure
-> Hint Agent — provides context-based hints when the student gets stuck
-> Revision Agent — gives summaries when a level is failed
-> Progress Tracker Agent — records scores, time, and completion
-> Analytics Agent — generates performance insights
-> Gameplay Engine — orchestrates the full escape-room flow

Flow
-> Upload PDF
-> Extract topics
-> Convert topics into levels
-> Play through timed puzzles
-> Receive hints or summaries as needed
-> Track progress across all levels

Goal
Make studying active, engaging, and fun by transforming plain notes into immersive escape-room puzzles powered by AI.
