# EduEscape

EduEscape converts any study PDF into an interactive **escape-room style learning experience**. It replaces passive revision with **active recall**, **timed challenges**, and **concept-based puzzles** to improve retention.

## How It Works

EduEscape transforms an uploaded PDF into a sequence of timed escape-room levels. Each level is generated from a topic extracted from the PDF.

### Core Components

- **PDF Reader Agent** – Extracts text from the uploaded PDF.
- **Topic Extraction Agent** – Identifies chapters and topics.
- **Escape Room Generator Agent** – Creates puzzles, clues, questions, and level structure.
- **Hint Agent** – Provides context-based hints when the student is stuck.
- **Revision Agent** – Shows topic summaries when the student fails a level.
- **Progress Tracker Agent** – Logs scores, time taken, and completed levels.
- **Analytics Agent** – Generates performance insights and dashboards.
- **Gameplay Engine** – Orchestrates gameplay and manages level flow.
